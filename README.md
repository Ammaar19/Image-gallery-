An image gallery using basic HTML and CSS is a collection of images displayed on a web page in a grid or gallery format. The gallery can be created using basic HTML and CSS without the need for complex programming languages or frameworks.

To create an image gallery, you would typically start by creating a container element using HTML, such as a div or ul element, to hold the images. Inside this container, you would add image elements, such as img tags, with the source attribute pointing to the location of the image file.

To display the images in a gallery format, you would then use CSS to style the container and images. This can include setting the width and height of the images, setting a margin or padding between images, and using CSS positioning to align the images in a grid or gallery format.

You can also add additional CSS styles to apply hover effects when a user hovers over an image, such as changing the border or background color of the image, or adding a caption or description when the user clicks on the image.

Overall, an image gallery using basic HTML and CSS is a simple and effective way to display a collection of images on a web page, without the need for complex programming languages or frameworks.
